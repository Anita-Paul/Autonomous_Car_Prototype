Project Title Autonomous Car Prototype
Technologies Deep Computer Vision
Domain Automobile

Problem Statement:
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are gaining popularity around the world. The potential of
this technology is undeniable, and it is expected to transform transportation as we know
It.
The advantages of autonomous driving range from lowering pollution in urban areas by
increasing driving and fuel efficiency to assisting in traffic flow and parking
management.
Furthermore, autonomous cars would improve the efficiency of people and freight
transportation while also increasing security by decreasing human mistake. Several
automotive firms, including BMW, Bosch, Toyota, Tesla, and others, have made
autonomous car (driverless car) research a priority in recent years.
Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Mobile Robotics research have all seen recent
advancements. Deep Learning and, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) advancements are noteworthy, with promising results. CNNs are said to have
made a significant breakthrough, with their findings outperforming state-of-the-art
systems on tasks including object identification and classification, semantic
segmentation and interpretation (even surpassing human skills).
CNNs are attracting a lot of attention these days, whether as a novel technique of
extracting robust features to replace hand-crafted ones or as an end-to-end trainable
system. This backdrop encourages us to contribute to the study and development of
novel and resilient Convolutional Neural Network-based algorithms that will replace
current computer vision approaches in autonomous vehicle perception systems.

The main objective: -
Document and develop an autonomous car prototype using edge devices like jetson
nano, Xavier and ROS Problem: Autonomous car is an automated or autonomous
vehicle capable of fulfilling the main transportation capabilities of a traditional car
without human input. Autonomous vehicles are capable to reduce crashes, pollution,
reduce crashes and costs of congestio
